C++ program, rldecoder.cpp, is designed to read a file containing Run-Length Encoded (RLE) data and decompress it into a series of characters based on the counts provided. Below, Iâ€™ll explain how the program works, point out a few improvements, and discuss how it could be extended to create images from the decompressed data.

Functionality Overview
File Input:

The program prompts the user to enter a filename for the RLE-encoded file.
It attempts to open the specified file and checks if the file exists. If the file doesn't exist, it displays an error message and exits.
RLE Processing:

The program reads pairs of count and character from the file, where the count indicates how many times the character should be repeated.
It uses a while loop to read the data until the end of the file, printing the decompressed characters to the console.
Output:

The decompressed characters are printed directly to the standard output.
